# C Test Program

Merge and Sort algorithm implemented in C language

## Build Requirements

- GCC Compiler
- Make

### Project Structure

ðŸ“‚ CTest/ (Main directory for the C project)  
â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“‚ src/ (Contains all C source files)  
â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“‚ build/ (Created after `make` is run, stores compiled files)  
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“‚ output/ (Created after `make release`, stores output files)  
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ program (Compiled executable)

#### Build Instructions

1. Navigate to the project directory
   `cd CTest`

2. Compile the program
   `make`

3. Run the program in debug mode (outputs the last 10 lines):
   `make debug`

4. Run the program and save output to a file
   `make release`
   - This will prompt you to enter a file number, creating an output file:
     output_c_x.txt  (where x is your input)

5. Clean the build directory (removes compiled files and output files):
   `make clean`

#### Additional Notes

- The `make release` command will store output in the `build/output/` directory.
- The executable file is stored in `build/`.
- Ensure you have `make` installed to use these commands
